// A zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers is given. The dominator of array arr is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of arr.
// For example, consider array arr such that arr = [3,4,3,2,3,1,3,3]
// The dominator of arr is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of arr and 5 is more than a half of 8.
// Write a function dominator(arr) that, given a zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers, returns the dominator of arr. The function should return âˆ’1 if array does not have a dominator. All values in arr will be >=0.
