// 'Shout' phrase:
// Since in the example, the difference between the friends is 6 (F's index is 15 & that of Y's is 9), the shout phrase becomes 'Oiii F!'

// Consider the following differences and its output:
// Difference is 4 => 'Oii F!'
// 2 => 'Oi F!'
// 9 => 'Oiiiii F!'
// 0 => 'Oi F!'
// 1 => 'Oi F!'
// 20 => 'Oiiiiiiiiii F!'
// Some guides for coding
// Y will always be on the left and F will be on the right.
// The number of 'i's in the output must be >= 1
// All the inputs are valid...
